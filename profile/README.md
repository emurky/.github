## Hello there!
My name is **Safar Safarly** and I am a student of [_School 21_](https://21-school.ru) (Moscow campus).
School 21 was opened by Sber under [_Ã‰cole 42_](https://42.fr/en/homepage/) franchise and is a computer science school that gives guys like me a second chance to find themselves in (IT) world.
In School we were given new funny random names, such as mine - Emerita Murky (so that's why page is called emurky).

And as a student I'd have to make several projects to learn C programming, develop simple software using classic algorithms, discover access to the file system, and learn management of the UNIX processes. And also there are projects on C++ and oriented programming.

This page was created just to separate my school projects from my personal ones.
